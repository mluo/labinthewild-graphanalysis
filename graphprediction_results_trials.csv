Younger generations will need even more advertisement to be convinced to become consumers since they're born in millions of advertisements already. It's only logical the amount will keep rising and perhaps more dramatically than expected, since more funds are available towards advertising and the practice has become something of an 'art' in itself. I predict more and more extravagant sums will be devoted to advertising, since the need to 'win them young' will remain but become just more difficult."

The graph seems to indicate this happens steadily, though at some point it might present a smaller increase. Between the space of a few years, given no world wars or other globally affecting events take place, no great changes would take place, so the line would follow the progress it already has."
